- long_to_bytes(large_integer): Converts the large integer back to a byte sequence.
- byte_data.decode('ascii'): Decodes the byte sequence into a string, assuming it was originally encoded in ASCII.

This process essentially reverses the encoding described: it converts a number back into its original ASCII representation.
